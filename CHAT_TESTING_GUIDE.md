# AI Assistant Chat Testing Guide

## üß™ Comprehensive Chat Functionality Testing

### Prerequisites
- Development server running on `http://localhost:3002`
- Budget setup completed (go through onboarding first)
- Modern browser with developer tools

### Automated Testing
1. **Visit Chat Test Page**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3002/chat-test`
2. **Run Automated Tests**: Click "Run All Chat Tests" button
3. **Review Results**: Check the terminal-style output for all test results
4. **Test Custom Messages**: Use the input field to test specific scenarios

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### 1. Chat UI Components
- [ ] **Top App Bar**: Back button, title, home button
- [ ] **Chat Messages**: User bubbles (violet, right-aligned), assistant bubbles (white, left-aligned)
- [ ] **Input Bar**: Text field with Send button, Enter key support
- [ ] **Suggested Prompts**: 3 chips shown initially, disappear after first message
- [ ] **Quick Action Buttons**: Appear below assistant messages when available

#### 2. Basic Chat Flow
- [ ] **Welcome Message**: Shows on first load with current budget status
- [ ] **Message Sending**: Type message and press Enter or click Send
- [ ] **Loading State**: Shows bouncing dots while generating response
- [ ] **Auto-scroll**: Chat scrolls to bottom with new messages
- [ ] **Input Focus**: Input field focused on page load

#### 3. Intent Recognition Testing

##### Plan Intent
Test these messages and verify appropriate responses:
- [ ] "Plan dinner for $20 tomorrow"
- [ ] "Plan lunch for $15"
- [ ] "Plan coffee for $5"
- [ ] "Plan groceries for $50"

Expected: Responses should check budget availability and suggest actions.

##### Query Intent
Test these messages:
- [ ] "How much can I spend on Food?"
- [ ] "What's my Food budget?"
- [ ] "How much left for Transport?"
- [ ] "Check my Social budget"

Expected: Should show current spending, limits, and remaining amounts.

##### Reallocate Intent
Test these messages:
- [ ] "Reallocate $15 from Social to Food"
- [ ] "Move $10 from Transport to Food"
- [ ] "Transfer $20 from Other to Social"

Expected: Should verify available funds and offer reallocation actions.

##### Unknown Intent
Test these messages:
- [ ] "Hello, how are you?"
- [ ] "What's the weather?"
- [ ] "Help me with something else"

Expected: Should provide helpful guidance about available commands.

#### 4. Quick Action Functionality

##### Reallocate Actions
- [ ] Click "Reallocate $15 from Social to Food"
- [ ] Verify category limits update in real-time
- [ ] Check confirmation message appears
- [ ] Navigate to dashboard and verify changes persist

##### Add Transaction Actions
- [ ] Click "Add dinner to Food category"
- [ ] Verify transaction appears in recent activity
- [ ] Check remaining budget updates
- [ ] Verify transaction persists on refresh

##### Suggestion Actions
- [ ] Click any suggestion button (Plan dinner for $20, etc.)
- [ ] Verify message is sent as user message
- [ ] Check appropriate response is generated

#### 5. Edge Cases and Error Handling

##### Budget Constraints
- [ ] Try planning expense larger than remaining budget
- [ ] Try reallocating more than available in category
- [ ] Verify appropriate warnings and suggestions

##### Invalid Categories
- [ ] Ask about non-existent category
- [ ] Try reallocating to/from invalid categories
- [ ] Verify helpful error messages

##### Empty States
- [ ] Test with zero budget
- [ ] Test with no transactions
- [ ] Verify graceful handling

#### 6. State Integration
- [ ] Add transaction via chat, check dashboard updates
- [ ] Reallocate via chat, verify category limits change
- [ ] Refresh page, verify chat state resets but budget persists
- [ ] Navigate between chat and dashboard, verify consistency

#### 7. Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Test on mobile viewport (375px width)
- [ ] Verify chat bubbles scale properly
- [ ] Check input bar is accessible
- [ ] Test touch interactions with quick actions

### Browser Developer Tools Testing

#### 1. Console Errors
- [ ] Open DevTools Console
- [ ] No red error messages during chat interactions
- [ ] No warnings about missing dependencies

#### 2. Network Tab
- [ ] No failed API requests (should work offline)
- [ ] No unexpected network calls

#### 3. LocalStorage
- [ ] Budget data persists across refreshes
- [ ] Chat state resets (as expected)
- [ ] No chat data stored in localStorage

### Performance Testing

#### 1. Response Time
- [ ] Chat responses appear within 1-2 seconds
- [ ] No lag when typing in input field
- [ ] Smooth scrolling behavior

#### 2. Memory Usage
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended chat session
- [ ] Messages don't accumulate indefinitely

### Cross-Browser Testing
- [ ] Chrome/Chromium
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari (if on macOS)
- [ ] Mobile browsers

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Chat not responding
- **Cause**: Store not properly initialized
- **Fix**: Complete onboarding first, ensure budget is set

#### 2. Quick actions not working
- **Cause**: Store update functions not available
- **Fix**: Check console for errors, refresh page

#### 3. Intent not recognized
- **Cause**: Message doesn't match expected patterns
- **Fix**: Use suggested prompts or try rephrasing

#### 4. State not syncing
- **Cause**: Store updates not triggering re-renders
- **Fix**: Check store implementation, refresh page

### Debug Commands
```javascript
// In browser console
// Check store state
console.log(useBudgetStore.getState());

// Test intent parsing
console.log(parseIntent("Plan dinner for $20"));

// Test response generation
const snapshot = createStoreSnapshot(useBudgetStore.getState());
const responses = simulateAdvice("Plan dinner for $20", snapshot);
console.log(responses);
```
